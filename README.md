# Extension Battleship
		The goal of this project is to add things to your program naval battle! 
		to make it more complex and fun to play.
	
		We present you need to perform:

#### Make several ships:
		You'll have to be careful because you must make sure not put a ship on 
		another ship on the game board. We also want to make sure you balance 
		the board size to the number of ships so that the game is still 
		challenging and fun to play.

#### Make ships of different sizes:
		It's more complicated than it looks. All parts of the ship must be 
		placed vertically or horizontally and you have to make sure you do not 
		accidentally put a ship off the board, and also where you placed one can 
		do not put another

#### Create your own game for one and two players:
		Remember that the player can choose to play alone or with a partner 
		must create an attractive menu and find ways for players wanting to 
		play more and more!

#### Requirements to Comply:

		• You must use classes for creating the game.
		• Create a menu where you use dictionaries where you show the game instructions and
		  options the user can choose.
		• You must clean the screen each time the player begins his turn and
		  show only active player board. So you can see:
			○ Your board with the positions of their ships and shots have been made.
			○ The board enemy ships sunk or errors made shots.
			○ The status of events that made the user:
				◘ Show username.
				◘ Number of Turns.
				◘ How many ships sunk and few left to sink.

		2. You can use words or numbers for the user to choose their options.

####Output messages
		1. Remember to show support you when I performed an action wrong 
		   in your application.



# Running tests
When inside the project directory, run `nosetests` in the terminal. Your code should work perfectly.
